 Pain when I see your face
 Im being punished and that's why I try
 Walking into familiar out of time and place
 I can still hear all the times they cry

 If my tongue was soft like their skin I could
 talk my way through a syntax of sin
 I want to reach out and touch you without the static 
 in-between late nights I drift inside a dream
